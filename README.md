# V-Bridge-Worker 🚀

A universal reverse proxy for **WebSocket-based protocols** (VLESS, VMess, Trojan) on Cloudflare Workers. Specifically designed to bypass network restrictions, fix direct connection issues, and enhance privacy for edge-based tunneling.

## 🎯 Purpose

V-Bridge-Worker acts as a secure bridge between your client and your target server. It is ideal for:
- **Bypassing Censorship:** Fixes connection issues for configurations that are blocked or filtered in your region.
- **IP Masking:** Hides your real IP from the target server provider.
- **SSL Offloading:** Provides a valid Cloudflare SSL/TLS layer for non-SSL target IPs.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Universal Protocol Support:** Works with any WebSocket-based configuration (VLESS, VMess, Trojan).
- **Bypass Direct Filtering:** Routes your traffic through Cloudflare's global network to bypass local blocks.
- **Auto-Protocol Fallback:** Automatically switches to HTTP if the target server lacks an SSL certificate.
- **Zero-Latency Streaming:** Optimized for real-time data transfer with no buffering.
- **Double Stealth Engine:** Bi-directional header masking (Nginx spoofing) to remain invisible to DPI scanners.
- **Request Efficiency:** Built-in noise filtering to preserve your daily 100k request limits.
- **Full UDP Support:** Compatible with UDP encapsulation for high-quality voice calls and gaming.

## 🛠 Deployment

1.  Log in to your **Cloudflare Dashboard**.
2.  Go to **Workers & Pages** and create a new Worker named `v-bridge-worker`.
3.  Copy the content of `worker.js` from this repository.
4.  Paste it into the Worker editor and click **Deploy**.

## 📖 Configuration Guide

Update your client (v2rayNG, Nekobox, etc.) with the following settings:

### 1. Connection Details
- **Address:** A clean Cloudflare IP (e.g., `www.speedtest.net`).
- **Port:** `443` (Recommended) or any supported Cloudflare port listed below.
- **Request Host:** `your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`
- **SNI:** `your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`
- **TLS:** Enabled (for HTTPS ports) or Disabled (for HTTP ports).

### 2. Dynamic Path Format
The path structure is: `/{TARGET_HOST}:{PORT}/{ORIGINAL_PATH}`

- **Standard Port (443):** `/my-server.com/ws`
- **Custom Port (10002):** `/my-server.com:10002/ws`
- **Auto-Fallback:** If the target lacks SSL, the relay automatically switches to HTTP.

## 🌐 Supported Cloudflare Ports

You can use any of the following ports in your client configuration:

| Protocol | Supported Ports |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTTPS (TLS ON)** | `443, 2053, 2083, 2087, 2096, 8443` |
| **HTTP (TLS OFF)** | `80, 8080, 8880, 2052, 2082, 2086, 2095` |

## 🔒 Security & Stealth

V-Bridge-Worker is designed to be invisible. 
- **Decoy Mode:** Direct access to the Worker URL returns a standard **Nginx 404 Not Found** page.
- **Header Masking:** All Cloudflare-specific fingerprints are stripped, mimicking a standalone
